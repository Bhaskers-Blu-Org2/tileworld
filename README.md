# TileWorld

TileWorld is a game creation app that allows you to design and play games directly on [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) devices.  TileWorld games are based on the familiar paradigm of a board with pieces that can move from one tile of the board to an adjacent tile.  TileWorld can be used to introduce computational concepts and its games are simple enough to design and simulate using basic classroom materials before programming them on an Arcade device. 

# Load Screen and Navigation

The load screen of TileWorld lets you select one of four games to design/program.  All game assets (game board, images and rules) are stored in the flash memory of your Arcade device, so your changes will remain even if you power the device off. All editing takes place via the tile paradigm: move the square-shaped cursor between adjacent tiles using the direction pad (dpad); select a tile using the A button to perform an action; the B button takes you back (to the menu of the current screen or to previous screen). Assets are saved to flash whenever you transition between screens.
