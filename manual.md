# Getting Started

You can run TileWorld in your [web browser](https://microsoft.github.io/pxt-tileworld/), or on any MakeCode Arcade device.
Simply copy the appropriate [UF2 file](download-link) to your MakeCode Arcade device to get started. 

# Load Screen and Navigation

The load screen of TileWorld lets you select one of four games to design/program.  
All game assets (game board, images and rules) are stored in the flash memory of your Arcade device, 
so your changes will remain even if you power the device off. All editing takes place via the tile paradigm: 
move the square-shaped cursor between adjacent tiles using the direction pad (dpad); select a tile using the 
A button to perform an action; the B button takes you back (to the menu of the current screen or to previous screen). 
Assets are saved to flash whenever you transition between screens.
