# Getting Started

You can run TileWorld in your [web browser](https://microsoft.github.io/pxt-tileworld/), or on any [MakeCode Arcade device](https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware).
Simply copy the appropriate [UF2 file](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-tileworld/releases/) to your MakeCode Arcade device to get started. 


# Load Screen and Navigation

The load screen of TileWorld lets you select one of four games to design/program.  
All game assets (game board, images and rules) are stored in the flash memory of your Arcade device, 
so your changes will remain even if you power the device off. All editing takes place via the tile paradigm: 
move the square-shaped cursor between adjacent tiles using the direction pad (dpad); select a tile using the 
A button to perform an action; the B button takes you back (to the menu of the current screen or to previous screen). 
Assets are saved to flash whenever you transition between screens.

The settings wheel (upper right of the load screen) allows you to delete all the current games from the flash settings.  This is useful if you want to load in games from another user (more on this later). You can also selectively delete games, as discussed later.

# Sharing Your TileWorld Games

The easiest way to share a TileWorld game you have created on an Arcade device is to copy the UF2 file from your device and share it with your friend.  The UF2 file includes the flash settings in which your games are stored. When your friend copies this UF2 file to their Arcade device, they will get the games you created.   Keep in mind that if your friend's Arcade device is not the same as yours, this may not work.

# Game Home Page

When you load a game, you will see the game's home page, as shown below:

You have four kinds of tiles and four kinds of sprites to work with. 

## Help

Move the cursor around the screen to get help about all the features available:

You can visit the art gallery to change the art associated with each kind of tile or sprite.  Once you get used to the features available in TileWorld, you can turn off the help suggestions via the gear wheel on your game's home page. 

## Menu bar

Their are four main commands available on the menu bar of the game's home page: map editor, art editor, code editor, and play game:
